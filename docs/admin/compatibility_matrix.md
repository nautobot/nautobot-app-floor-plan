# Compatibility Matrix

Because this App depends on Nautobot's `Location` data model, which was introduced in Nautobot 1.4.0, the initial release of this App requires at least Nautobot 1.4.0. It should work with all later Nautobot 1.x.y versions.

Because this App adopted the Nautobot UI Component Framework, any version beyond 2.8.X will require Nautobot 2.4.0 or higher.

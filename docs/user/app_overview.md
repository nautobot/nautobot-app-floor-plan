!!! note
    Throughout this documentation, the terms "app" and "plugin" will be used interchangeably.

## Description

This App is designed to extend Nautobot's built-in Location data model to allow you to define a Floor Plan for each relevant Location, consisting of a grid of Tiles, each of which has coordinates, an optional Status, and an optional association to a Rack belonging to that Location in order to show the Rack's position within the Floor Plan. The Floor Plan will be displayed in the Nautobot UI as a rendered SVG with built in pan/zoom capabilities using your mouse.
